# Queens Game - Making - Backtracking Solving

# solution() and game_arr[]:
    In solution function we choose a solution for the right places of columns and rows. So, we can forward through this game_arr array.
    Example of game_arr = [7, 3, 6, 1, 5, 8, 4, 2, 0] it is like 0th row 7th column is queen, 1th row 3th column is queen .....
    
# table_arr[]:
    It include colors and queens in an ordinary table.Firstly it has 0's and (i+10)'s for every color of queens.
    Example of table_arr(first_situation) = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 10, 0], [0, 0, 0, 11, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 12, 0, 0], [0, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 14, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 15], [0, 0, 0, 0, 16, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 17, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [18, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
